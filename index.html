                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an accomplished and results-oriented U.S. Air Force Technical Sergeant with 11 years of progressively higher leadership and management experience. My passion for problem-solving and technology has driven me to pursue opportunities in the Information Technology industry, particularly in roles such as Project Manager, Data Analyst, Software Developer, or Solutions Architect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my career, I have demonstrated success in leading teams through complex challenges, utilizing various programming languages and methodologies. Notable achievements include developing a proof-of-concept Python application to automate weather watches, warnings, and advisories, resulting in significant manpower savings and increased organizational readiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a leader, I have spearheaded teams responsible for critical missions, such as conducting the largest cocaine arrest in U.S. Coast Guard history and providing vital weather support for the evacuation of one million refugees and 2,000 American citizens. Additionally, my expertise in weather prediction modeling and Python coding, coupled with strong communication skills, make me well-equipped for roles in data analytics, software development, or solutions architecture.
